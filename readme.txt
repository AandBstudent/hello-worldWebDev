Most Interesting fact about you. I have spent tine researching a grant I proposed
                                 to Oregon NASA grant consortium. I began last
                                 term on my research project to Model and Simulate
                                 particular phenomena of Normal forces in Low
                                 gravity. I used the system dynamics software
                                 STELLA to create a Model and Simulate a stack
                                 of 27 nickels falling in a drop tower for 2.1
